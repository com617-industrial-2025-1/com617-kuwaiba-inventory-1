This is for the Thursday morning team looking at kuwaiba. If you have move teams , please ignore this. Please forward to the rest of your team if I have missed someone out.

Please come in at 09.00 on Thursday so we can put some effort into looking at the telecoms / street map problem. 

Bring a laptop with docker desktop installed https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

Although this is complicated, what I really want of the project is quite simple. We need to extract the street plan / fibre infrastructure and house locations There may already be free tools available to do this, and part of the exercise will be to discover and evaluate these tools.
1. given an area on open street map, can we extract the streets and houses
2. can we automatically predict/design where the street cabinets / telephone poles / manhole covers / fibre ducts will be.
3. can we export this information to kuwaiba.

I am not an expert on GIS but I have googled the following information:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69174361/how-to-extract-street-graph-or-network-from-openstreetmap    How to extract street graph or network from OpenStreetMap?
* https://openinframap.org/#2/26/12   open infrastructure map
* https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Infrastructure_Map
* extracting streets from the model https://github.com/a-b-street/osm2streets    osm2streets provides a simplified street network schema, a library transforming OSM data into this representation, and tools to render and work with the results.
